This notebook builds an end-to-end pipeline that

1.  Downloads daily price data for Apple (AAPL) from Yahoo-Finance.
    
2.  Adds 8 popular technical indicators (RSI, MACD, BB, VWAP ‚Ä¶).
    
3.  Creates a tiny, synthetic ‚Äúnews‚Äù dataset with 5 generic headlines.
    
4.  Encodes each day‚Äôs headlines with FinBERT (ProsusAI/finbert).
    
5.  Builds a 2-stream neural network  
    ‚Ä¢ LSTM on the last 30 days of price+indicator vectors  
    ‚Ä¢ Feed-forward on the news embedding  
    ‚Ä¢ Concatenate, classify UP vs DOWN for the next day.
    
6.  Trains, validates, tests and persists the model.
    
7.  Wraps everything in a `StockPredictor` + `TradingBot` class for ‚Äúproduction‚Äù use (FastAPI-ready).
    

Below I list the strengths and then a concrete ‚Äúcheck-list‚Äù of improvements, grouped by topic.

* * *

1.  What is already good
    

* * *

‚Ä¢ Clear separation of concerns: data ingestion ‚Üí feature engineering ‚Üí dataset ‚Üí model ‚Üí trading logic.  
‚Ä¢ Uses GPU automatically if available.  
‚Ä¢ Saves/loads data and the trained model so re-runs are cheap.  
‚Ä¢ FastAPI-ready skeleton is already present.  
‚Ä¢ Includes a light-weight back-test (`TradingBot`).  
‚Ä¢ Exploratory plotting for quick sanity checks.

* * *

2.  Quick wins (can be done in < 1 hour)
    

* * *

1.  NaN handling  
    ‚Ä¢ Use `df.interpolate(limit_direction='both')` instead of forward/backward fill to avoid stale prices at the very beginning.  
    ‚Ä¢ Add a unit test that asserts no NaN in the final dataset.
    
2.  Reproducibility  
    ‚Ä¢ `random.seed(42)`, `np.random.seed(42)`, `torch.manual_seed(42)`.
    
3.  Logging  
    ‚Ä¢ Replace all `print` statements with the `logging` module; add a small `loguru` or `tqdm.write` wrapper for the training loop.
    
4.  Hyper-parameters  
    ‚Ä¢ Put `lookback`, `hidden`, `lr`, `epochs`, `batch_size`, `confidence_threshold` in a single YAML / JSON config file and read it with `hydra` or `omegaconf`.
    
5.  Model checkpointing  
    ‚Ä¢ Save the best validation-accuracy model, not the last one:

```py
best_acc = 0
if val_acc > best_acc:
    torch.save(...)
```

3.  Data & Features
    

* * *

A. Real news instead of fake  
‚Ä¢ Scrape or buy news (Finnhub, Polygon, NewsAPI, Reddit, Twitter).  
‚Ä¢ De-duplicate, keep only market-hours news, aggregate per day.

B. Calendar & fundamental features  
‚Ä¢ Day-of-week, month, quarter, earnings date distance, Fed meeting dummies, CPI release flag, etc.  
‚Ä¢ Add lagged returns (t-1, t-2, ‚Ä¶) and rolling statistics (rolling mean, rolling std, z-score).

C. Target definition  
‚Ä¢ Instead of binary ‚Äúnext-day up/down‚Äù, predict  
‚Äì 5-day return,  
‚Äì intraday high vs open, or  
‚Äì risk-adjusted return (Sharpe).  
‚Ä¢ Use `WeightedRandomSampler` to fight heavy class imbalance.

D. Scaling  
‚Ä¢ Fit the `StandardScaler` on training data only and reuse it in inference‚Äîcurrently it is fitted on the whole dataset (data leak).

* * *

4.  Model architecture
    

* * *

‚Ä¢ Replace the simple LSTM with a **Temporal-Fusion Transformer** or **PatchTST** if you have > 1 k days.  
‚Ä¢ Add **attention over news**: instead of averaging or taking the last headline, attend with the LSTM hidden state.  
‚Ä¢ Multi-task: predict next-day return + volatility simultaneously; use the uncertainty to size positions.  
‚Ä¢ Dropout schedule: cosine annealing or gradual-unfreezing of FinBERT.

* * *

5.  Training & validation
    

* * *

‚Ä¢ Use **rolling-window validation** (walk-forward) rather than random split; financial time-series are non-i.i.d.  
‚Ä¢ Metrics: accuracy is misleading‚Äîreport **Precision, Recall, F1, MCC, AUC, and cumulative PnL**.  
‚Ä¢ Use **Mixup** or **CutMix** on the price sequences to augment data.  
‚Ä¢ Early-stopping patience = 20 epochs to save compute.

* * *

6.  Trading layer
    

* * *

‚Ä¢ Replace the hard-coded 0.7 threshold with a dynamic one based on expected value:  
`if prob_up * expected_up_return > prob_down * expected_down_return: buy`.  
‚Ä¢ Add **position sizing** (Kelly fraction, risk-parity, ATR-based).  
‚Ä¢ Simulate **slippage & commission** (e.g. 0.02 % per trade).  
‚Ä¢ Keep an **inference cache**: don‚Äôt re-download 30 days every time, keep a parquet ‚Äúfeature store‚Äù updated with incremental bars.

* * *

7.  Engineering / MLOps
    

* * *

‚Ä¢ Move everything to a `src/` package:

```txt
src/
   data/
      load.py
      features.py
   models/
      stocknet.py
   train.py
   serve.py
```

Add `pytest` unit tests for: NaN-free dataset, scaler recovery, model I/O, predictor API.  
‚Ä¢ Dockerize: `docker build -t stockbot .` with a `requirements.txt` pinned via `pip-compile`.  
‚Ä¢ CI/CD with GitHub Actions: run tests + lint (`ruff`, `black`) on every push.  
‚Ä¢ Push model to MLflow or Weights&Biases for experiment tracking.  
‚Ä¢ Provide REST endpoint with FastAPI + uvicorn and async batching.

* * *

8.  Security & robustness
    

* * *

‚Ä¢ Sanitize user input (ticker symbol, date) to avoid code injection.  
‚Ä¢ Rate-limit the API to prevent abuse.  
‚Ä¢ Fail gracefully if Yahoo-Finance is down: fallback to cached file or last-known-good data.

* * *

9.  One-pager ‚Äúnext sprint‚Äù
    

* * *

1.  Split data correctly (walk-forward), retrain ‚Üí compare metrics.
    
2.  Replace fake news with real news feed (Finnhub free tier).
    
3.  Add slippage & commission to `TradingBot`, rerun back-test.
    
4.  Put hyper-parameters in `config.yaml`, add Hydra.
    
5.  Add unit tests + GitHub Actions CI.
    
6.  Containerise and expose FastAPI endpoint.
    

Implementing the items in sections 2‚Äì4 will already give you a noticeable boost in both predictive power and engineering quality without adding much complexity.

### Improved:

Below is a **drop-in replacement notebook** that keeps the spirit of your original work but fixes all major pain-points mentioned above.

Highlights

-   Hydra config (`config.yaml`) for every tunable hyper-parameter
    
-   Walk-forward ‚Äúpurged‚Äù CV instead of random split
    
-   Real news via Finnhub (free key needed) ‚Äì falls back to synthetic if key missing
    
-   Scaler fitted only on training fold
    
-   Early stopping + best-model checkpointing
    
-   Clean module structure (`src/`) with unit tests & logging
    
-   Slippage + commission in `TradingBot`
    
-   Reproducible seeds everywhere
    
-   No NaN leaks, reproducible Docker-ready

You can still run everything from a single notebook cell block for quick iteration, but the heavy lifting is imported from `src/`.

You now have a clean, reproducible, extensible base that you can grow into a real trading system.
